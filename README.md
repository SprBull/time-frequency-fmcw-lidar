## Video-rate high-precision time-frequency multiplexed 3D coherent ranging

This repository contains MATLAB code that computes the 3D depth map from raw interferogram data acquired by the time-frequency multiplexed 3D coherent ranging system. For more details, you can read our paper at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29177-9. The raw inteferogram data of three datasets, including a mannequin head, two cups and a video of a human hand actively flexing, can be downloaded from : https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19144388 as .mat files.
